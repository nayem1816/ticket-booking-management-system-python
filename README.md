# Ticket Booking Management System

A ticket booking management system can include a feature to check the license of the ride manager, which would ensure that the person operating the event or ride has a valid license and is qualified to do so. This can include checking for proper certifications, training, and qualifications, as well as ensuring that the license is up-to-date and valid.

The Ride Manager feature in a ticket booking management system allows to create, edit and manage all the rides available in the park. It allows the park operator to set up different ride types, capacities, durations, and other details. It also enables the park operator to manage the ride schedule, assign staff, and track ride usage and maintenance. This feature can also help in identifying the popular rides and allocate resources accordingly.
